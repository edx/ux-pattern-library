### Contributing and the edX Pattern Library
There are a few additional details alongside our general guidelines to keep in mind contributing to the edX Pattern Library:

#### Pattern Library Features, Ideas, and Improvements
If you're looking to suggest an idea or you're thinking about developing a
feature, start a discussion [by visiting the Open edX JIRA
site](https://openedx.atlassian.net/secure/Dashboard.jspa) and  create a new
"Issue" by selecting the "Create" button at the top of the page. Choose the
project "edX Pattern Library" and the issue type "New Feature" or "Improvement"
(you may first need to [create a free JIRA
account](https://openedx.atlassian.net/admin/users/sign-up)).

#### Bugs and Issues
If you notice an issue or a bug with the Pattern Library, we would love ot hear
about it! Follow the above instructions on logging a new edX Pattern Library JIRA issue and then assign the issue type of "Bug" to your issue. An edX UX & Front End Development Team member will then take it from there and triage your bug.

Conversely, if you want to help resolve any known [bugs/issues](https://openedx.atlassian.net/projects/UXPL/issues), which are tracked in JIRA, you can [create a free JIRA account](https://openedx.atlassian.net/admin/users/sign-up) and then comment on the ticket to indicate that you are working on it. Don't hesitate to ask clarifying questions on the ticket as needed, too, if anything is unclear.

#### Submitting Code
For code contributions, please open up a pull request! PRs will get OSPR tickets assigned to them, as mentioned in the above contributing guidelines.

#### Approval by UX and Front End Team Members
An edX UX or Front End Development Team member will be working with you on any pull requests you make.
They will be evaulating your pull request from a design point of view as well as from a Front End Development perspective. Other team members as well as UI/Front End Developers may also lend a hand.

#### Tests
The edX Pattern Library source code doesn't currently leverage the Open edX test
suite nor are there any automated tests configured for this codebase currently.

#### Front End Development Standards
In addition to the general contributor documentation, any contributions should
meet specific Front End Development requirements, including the guidelines and
principles listed in:

* [General Front End Styleguide](https://github.com/edx/ux-pattern-library/wiki/Styleguide:-General)
* [Accessibility Styleguide](https://github.com/edx/ux-pattern-library/wiki/Styleguide:-Accessibility)
* [HTML Styleguide](https://github.com/edx/ux-pattern-library/wiki/Styleguide:-HTML)
* [Forms Styleguide](https://github.com/edx/ux-pattern-library/wiki/Styleguide:-Forms)
* [Sass & CSS Styleguide](https://github.com/edx/ux-pattern-library/wiki/Styleguide:-Sass-&-CSS), including [right-to-left support](https://github.com/edx/ux-pattern-library/wiki/Styleguide:-Sass-&-CSS#right-to-left-rtl-support)
